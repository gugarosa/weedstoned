## Getting started: 60 seconds with WeedStoned

First of all. Code is all commented. Yes, they are commented. Just browse to any file, chose your subpackage, and follow it. We have high-level code for most tasks we could think of.

Alternatively, if you wish to learn even more, please take a minute:

WeedStoned is based on the following structure, and you should pay attention to its tree:

```
- weedstoned
    - public
    - src
        - assets
        - components
        - data
        - utils
        - views
        - App.js
        - App.scss
        - Routes.js
        - index.js
```

### Public

This folder holds all the base public files that will be further generated and served. Only use if you need to change the favicon or configure any relevant header that must be present on HTML files.

### Source

Known as ```src```, this is where all the magic happens. Follow along the next items to understand what is happening here.

#### assets

External assets should be created and used here. We will be using SCSS as your pre-processor for CSS files. You can also add here static images if needed.

#### components

Every component should be placed here. An intelligent application uses a trade-off between when componentization should happen or not. For layout-related components, we assume this is a must.

#### data

These are data objects that feeds the components. For example, you might want to change what use your own TCG instead of WeedStoned.

#### utils

Utilities should be placed and loaded here. We encapsulate some common definitions so they can be used throughout the whole project.

#### views

Views are the "face" of your application. Essentially, they are a bunch of components, assume a route and perform in a particular way inside the application.

## Installation

We believe that everything has to be easy. Not tricky or daunting, WeedStoned will be the one-to-go package that you will need, from the very first installation to the daily-tasks implementing needs.

### Development

Next, install the needed requirements by performing the following commands:

```
npm install | yarn install
```

Finally, you can start the development service:

```

```

All bootstrap commands were pre-loaded when this package was created. We have strictly followed the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
